Template #1: "How to / The Secret to" Template

Description:

This template is designed to create LinkedIn posts that offer a step-by-step guide or reveal the secret to achieving a specific goal or solving a problem. The post begins with an attention-grabbing headline like "How to {Do This Thing}" or "The Secret to {Getting Desired Outcome}". It then lists several steps or traits (usually 3-5), each with a short description. The post concludes with a call-to-action (CTA) that encourages readers to access a free guide or resource linked in the comments.

Example:

How to create a killer Intro Section on your LinkedIn profile (5 little-known steps anyone can use)

Background photo: Use a 'soft' CTA.
Name: No confusing letters or jargon words.
Profile pic: Smile, look at the camera, no distractions.
Headline: Niche, problem, outcome of solving problem.
Empathy: Deeply understand your audience through research.
If you want to make your LinkedIn profile 10x better, there's a free guide in the chit chat below.

Template #2: "The Rant" Template

Description:

Use this template to create posts that express frustration or dissatisfaction about a particular issue relevant to your audience. Start by hinting that a rant is coming to grab attention. Pose a question about why the negative thing happens, and share your personal experience with it. Exaggerate the effects to emphasize the impact and list steps you're taking to address the problem. Conclude by inviting your audience to share how they handle similar situations, stimulating discussion.

Example:

I'm sorry but I'm going to have a little rant today...

Why do people book calls and then not show up?

I've had 5 no-shows this week and I'm feeling very frustrated by it!

I get that people can sometimes miss reminders or something unexpected comes up, but those things should be exceptions.

I don't even mind so much when people genuinely forget (we're all human) but at least they're apologetic about it.

Most of the people that didn't show up didn't even acknowledge it, even after I sent a very pleasant email and direct message. That's just rude!

I'm tired of people not respecting my time so I've decided to do 4 things:

Make it way harder for people to book calls with me by 'tightening up' my application form and kicking out the tire-kickers.
Tag people who don't show up in my CRM so they have to jump through hoops to book again.
Ensure the SMS reminder option is available for all bookings.
Send a direct message to confirm they will actually make it!
Hopefully, that will cut down the no-shows!

OK, rant over‚Äîthanks for letting me vent! üòÖ

I'm curious, how do you handle no-shows? And what do you do to minimize them?

Template #3: "Polarization" Template

Description:

This template is for creating posts that present a controversial or polarizing statement to spark debate and engagement. Start with a bold statement that challenges common beliefs. Provide reasoning and evidence to support your viewpoint. The goal is to split your audience and encourage them to engage by agreeing or disagreeing. End with a call-to-action inviting them to share their thoughts.

Example:

Becoming a coach is easy.

Creating a business around it is not.

Why do most coaches scrape by while only a few thrive and prosper?

I've spoken to thousands and worked with hundreds of coaches over the last few years, and there are some commonalities I see that differentiate successful coaches from the rest:

Unshakable belief: They believe deeply in their ability to get incredible results for clients.
Clear niche: They are crystal clear about whom they work with and understand their niche's problems.
Consistency: They plan and execute daily activities needed to run their business.
Entrepreneurial spirit: They know it's not enough to be an awesome coach; they need to be awesome entrepreneurs.
Seek help: They get guidance from those who've succeeded before them.
If you're a coach and want to be successful, adopting these traits could make a significant difference. Are you up for that?

I'd love to know if you agree or disagree. Tell me in the comments, please. üòÅ

Template #4: "Data-Driven" Template

Description:

Create posts that leverage impactful statistics to highlight a problem or opportunity in your industry. Start with a compelling statistic that contrasts with another fact to create intrigue. Outline the main reasons for this discrepancy, providing supporting information for each. Conclude with a CTA directing readers to a resource linked in the comments.

Example:

The life coaching industry is estimated to be worth $2,400,000,000. Yet 56% of coaches are earning less than $1,000 per month.

There are three main reasons for this:

Lack of niche: Without focusing on a specific group, marketing messages fail to break through the noise.
Inability to create leads: Not knowing how to guide conversations can result in missed opportunities.
Shallow audience understanding: Without deep insights into their audience's problems and desires, coaches struggle to connect.

Template #5A: "Three Things" Template

Description:

Use this template to present three actionable tips or steps to achieve a desired outcome. Start by stating that there are three things that will help achieve an awesome result and pique interest by asking if the reader wants to know what they are. List each point with a brief explanation. Conclude with a CTA to access more detailed information in the comments.

Example:

There are 3 things you can do right now on LinkedIn to help grow your network.

Wanna know what they are?

Here you go...

Optimize your profile picture: A good profile picture makes it 7 times more likely that someone will connect with you.
Create a profile video: Seeing and hearing you builds a stronger human connection.
Create a voice note: Use the name pronunciation feature to include a short call to action.
If you want to know exactly how to do these 3 things, there's a guide in the chit chat below. üëá

Template #5B: "Three Things Every [Topic] Should Include" Template

Description:

This template lists three essential elements that every [topic] should have, each with a short explanation. Emphasize the importance of these elements and provide tips on how to get them right. Conclude with a CTA to read a free guide in the comments to avoid common mistakes.

Example:

3 Things Every Good LinkedIn Headline Should Include:

The people you help: The narrower the niche, the better.
The problem you help them solve: Ask them about their problems.
The outcome they get by solving the problem: Ask them what they want.
The only real way to get this right is to:

Be crystal clear on who your niche is.
Reach out to them for research.
Write down what they tell you exactly as they say it.
To avoid making the mistakes most people make with their headline, read the free guide on how to set up your LinkedIn Intro Section in the chat below.

Template #5C: "Activity is Simple‚ÄîIf You Know How" Template

Description:

Assert that a particular activity is simple if you know how, highlighting that it involves doing three things well. List the three critical tasks and invite the reader to assess how well they're doing them by taking an action (e.g., a quiz or health check) provided in the comments. Encourage engagement by asking readers to share their results.

Example:

Generating leads for a coaching or consulting business on LinkedIn is simple‚Äîif you know how.

You just have to do 3 things well.

Wanna know what they are and how well you're doing them?

Set up your profile to attract your ideal clients.
Create content consistently that delivers value to your audience.
Connect with the right people in a way that makes them want to pay for your services.

Template #1: Narrative Approach
Stories have always captivated us, and for good reason.

They connect with us on an emotional level, making messages both entertaining and memorable.

That's why incorporating stories into your LinkedIn posts can be incredibly effective for capturing attention, building rapport, and encouraging engagement.

You can share a wide variety of stories on LinkedIn, including:

personal anecdotes,
business milestones,
success stories,
case studies, or
customer testimonials.

Template Instructions for a Story-Driven LinkedIn Post
-Begin with a personal anecdote: Start your post with a memorable or significant personal story.

-Share your initial emotions: Describe how you felt during this experience to connect emotionally with your readers.

-Introduce the turning point: Highlight the moment that changed the course of the events you are describing.

-Describe the outcome: Explain what happened as a result of the turning point.

-Reflect on the experience: Share insights or lessons learned from the experience.

-Offer encouragement and a takeaway: Provide a motivational insight or actionable advice that readers can apply in their own lives.

-Engage your readers with a question: Conclude with a question tha


Example:
"I remember the first time I spoke in front of 200 people.

I was incredibly nervous, and my ears turned red, which only made me more anxious.

Despite my fears, they called my name, and I stepped onto the stage.

Fifteen minutes later, I had finished my presentation.

It wasn't perfect, but it was a huge personal success.

This experience made me reconsider the opportunities I had missed by staying in my comfort zone.

Now, whenever I doubt my presentation skills, I remind myself, ‚ÄòIf you did it once, you can do it again.‚Äô

How about you? Are you comfortable stepping out of your comfort zone? How did you learn to embrace it?"


---

Template #2: Observational Insights
Observations are a daily part of human nature.

We observe people, events, and the world at large, which helps us form opinions, develop ideas, and learn.

Sharing these observations on LinkedIn is an excellent way to:

spark conversations,
provoke thought, and
engage your audience.
You can discuss anything from industry trends and current events to business insights and life lessons‚Äîanything that might interest or add value for your followers.


Template Instructions for an Observation-Based LinkedIn Post
- Start with what you observed: Initiate your post by describing a common discussion or trend you've noticed.

- Share your insight: Comment on the quality or accuracy of the observed trend or discussion.

- Reflect on why this might be: Analyze and explain possible reasons behind what you've observed.

- Conclude with a realization: Share a personal realization or broader conclusion you've drawn from your observation.

- Offer advice: Provide practical advice based on your conclusions that your audience can apply.

- Engage your audience with a question: Finish with a question that prompts your readers to reflect and respond, fostering engagement.

Example in Action
"I see many people on LinkedIn discussing the power of personal branding.

But I've noticed that much of the advice given is less than stellar.

It seems many offer suggestions that sound good, without real-world experience to back them up.

This made me realize that genuine expertise is rare, and it's crucial to verify someone's credentials before taking their advice.

Always research thoroughly and confirm the results someone claims, ensuring their guidance is reliable and applicable.

What's the best and worst advice you've ever received about LinkedIn? Share your experiences in the comments below!"


---

Template #3: Contrarian Perspective

Taking a contrarian stance on a popular issue, topic, or belief is a powerful way to differentiate yourself and drive engagement on LinkedIn‚Äîor any social media platform.

It‚Äôs not about being controversial for the sake of it, but rather presenting a well-reasoned, researched opinion that challenges mainstream ideas.

This approach can capture attention and spark meaningful discussions.



Template Instructions for a Contrarian Perspective LinkedIn Post
-State the common belief: Begin by stating a widely accepted opinion or belief.

-Introduce your contrasting viewpoint: Offer your differing perspective clearly and assertively.

-Explain your reasoning: Detail the reasons behind your viewpoint, providing logical explanations or evidence.

-Propose an alternative: Suggest a more beneficial or reasoned approach as an alternative to the common belief.

-Engage your audience: Encourage interaction by asking for their opinions on the topic.

-Call to action: Prompt your readers to engage further by commenting on the post.

Example in Action
"Many people believe that to be successful, you must hustle 24/7.

However, I think this is bad advice.

Constant hustling leaves no room to relax, recharge, or reflect, which are essential for peak performance and innovation.

Instead of maintaining a non-stop work ethic, incorporating regular downtime into your schedule is crucial.

What's your take on the 'hustle 24/7' mentality? Share your thoughts in the comments below!"

Template #4: Comparative Analysis
Comparisons are a fundamental way we make sense of the world.

By comparing people, experiences, products, and services, we gain a better understanding of their relative value and context.

This is why comparison-based content is so engaging and effective, especially on platforms like LinkedIn.

Using comparisons in your posts can vividly highlight differences, clarify your points, and present information in a new light, naturally boosting engagement.

Template Instructions for a Comparison LinkedIn Post
üëâ Introduction: Briefly introduce the two items or concepts you are comparing.

üëâThing A:

Trait 1: Describe the first characteristic.
Trait 2: Describe the second characteristic.
Trait 3: Describe the third characteristic.
Trait 4: Describe the fourth characteristic.
üëâThing B:

Trait 1: Describe the first characteristic of the second item, contrasting it with Thing A.
Trait 2: Describe the second characteristic, highlighting differences.
Trait 3: Describe the third characteristic, focusing on contrast.
Trait 4: Describe the fourth characteristic, underscoring how it differs from Thing A.
üëâCall to Action (CTA): Engage your audience by asking them a question related to the comparison to encourage interaction.

Example in Action
"Let's compare the qualities of an average LinkedIn post versus a great one:

Average LinkedIn Post:

Boring
Uninspired
Doesn‚Äôt provide value
Overly promotional
Great LinkedIn Post:

Engaging
Interesting
Informative
Valuable

Template #5: Structured Listices
Listicles are incredibly popular because they're concise, easy to digest, and typically packed with valuable insights.

This format is especially effective on LinkedIn, where readers are always on the lookout for new tips, tricks, and strategies to enhance their personal and professional lives.

Providing this information in a straightforward, list-based format can significantly boost your engagement.

When crafting a listicle, you can consider various types, such as:

top [insert number] lists,
how-to lists, or
resources lists, depending on what will be most beneficial for your audience.


Template for a Listicle-Based LinkedIn Post
üëâ Title: [X] Ways To [Achieve a Goal/Perform a Task]

üëâ Introduction: Offer a compelling intro that sets the stage for your list.

üëâ List Item 1: Title of Tip/Strategy

üëâ Explanation: Provide a brief 1-2 sentence description or explanation.

üëâ List Item 2: Title of Tip/Strategy

üëâ Explanation: Another brief description. Continue with more items as needed.

üëâ Conclusion: Summarize the key points or offer additional advice to wrap up the list.

üëâ Engagement Prompt: End with a question or call to action to encourage comments and interaction.

Example in Action
‚Äú5 Ways To Up Your LinkedIn Posting Game

If you're looking to enhance engagement on your LinkedIn posts, improving your strategy is key. Here‚Äôs how you can start:

1. Be more personal.

Share more about your personal experiences and behind-the-scenes moments. This approach helps humanize your profile and makes you more relatable.

2. Provide value.

Ensure every post offers something beneficial to your audience, whether it's educational, entertaining, or inspiring.

3. Maintain consistency.

Regular posting is crucial. Aim for a few times a week to maintain visibility and engagement.

4. Craft compelling hooks.

The first few lines of your post must grab attention and make people want to read more. Invest time in writing engaging hooks.

4. Format posts for readability.

Avoid large blocks of text by using paragraphs, subheadings, and white space to make your content easier to read.

Implement these strategies, and watch your LinkedIn engagement grow!

Template #1 - Grab them, shake them, show them the light

This template requires a little reverse engineering and taking a different point of view of a situation all your followers can connect with. 

Example:
Traditional leadership is failing. Quiet quitting is on the rise.  And that‚Äôs a good thing. Let me tell you why.
Let‚Äôs analyse the example.

‚ÄúClick here to learn more about [topic]‚Äù
Ask your audience a question about their opinion on a topic
